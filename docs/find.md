## Quick filter

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> opens a filter box under the file list. As you
type, the list shows only the matching names:

- plain text matches anywhere in the name (`report` finds `Q1-report.pdf`),
- with `*` or `?` it's a pattern for the whole name (`*.pdf`, `photo-??.jpg`).

Upper and lower case don't matter. <kbd>Enter</kbd> opens the selected match;
<kbd>Esc</kbd> closes the filter.

## Find files

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>, or the **magnifying glass** button, searches the
active panel's folder **and all its subfolders** by name.

1. Type part of a name, or a pattern like `*.pdf`, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
2. Results appear while the search runs, with the folder each one is in.
   **Stop** ends a long search; a search stops by itself after 1,000 results.
3. Open a result with <kbd>Enter</kbd>, a double click, or **Go to file**: the
   panel opens its folder with the file selected.
4. Or click **View in Listbox** to show **all the results as a tab** in the
   active panel, like Total Commander's "Feed to listbox". Each file shows its
   path inside the searched folder, and you can open, view, copy, move, rename
   or delete them as in any folder. Nothing can be copied or moved into that
   tab. Opening a folder or going up leaves the results.

Keys: <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>↓</kbd> moves into the results; <kbd>↑</kbd> /
<kbd>↓</kbd>, <kbd>Page Up</kbd> / <kbd>Page Down</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd> /
<kbd>End</kbd> move the highlight; <kbd>↑</kbd> on the first result goes back
to the name; <kbd>Esc</kbd> closes.

Hidden files are found only when **Show hidden files** is on. Searching
folders on a server isn't available yet.
