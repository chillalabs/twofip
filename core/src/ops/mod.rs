//! Async file operations (copy, move, delete-to-trash, rename, compress) with progress
//! reporting and cooperative cancellation.
//!
//! Copy/move/delete are exposed as streams of [`OpEvent`] rather than a single
//! future, so a caller (the UI) can show live progress and let the user cancel
//! mid-operation. Cancellation is checked between files, not mid-file, so
//! cancelling while copying one very large file lets that file finish first.
